                <h1 class="heading"> The story behind<br><span> Roast & Co.</span></h1>
                <p class="reflection">Our group, consisting of four individuals, scheduled a discord meet to discuss the report material and requirements and divided the work given among us, making it easier to plan the website structure.

                    Three ideas for different websites were suggested, but after reconsideration, a unanimous decision to make a coffee shop website located in Bahrain was made. The 3-subtopic main ideas were discussed, and an idea from each group member was taken into consideration. To conclude, a subtopic of menu, reviews, and roastery of the coffee shop was the final decision. 
                    The home page contains an overview of the project and a registry form with the location of the coffee shop; the menu page contains a list of the coffee shop products (lattes and pastries) with their prices. 
                    The review page contains customer reviews, and finally, the roastery contains informative information about the shop’s coffee bean roasts. 
                    <br>The work was divided between the four; each person's task was to create one or two web pages and then upload them into our GitHub repository. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                     Throughout the project, the group struggled with some setbacks. First, having to work on multiple projects for different subjects simultaneously and having to balance between all the work, which correspondingly caused a setback in our teamwork scheduled plan and then a delay in the overall predicted completion time of the project. 
                     The best way the group managed that problem was to assign sub-deadlines to each task, and with every sub-deadline, a checkup discord meeting would occur, where we would update our work and balance all projects, respectively.
                    To add up, since the group divided the subtopics, it was very challenging to end up with the same coherent theme for all web pages. We fixed that by making a GitHub repository where we add our work, and everyone can access it to view it and match the theme. 
                    <br>Additionally, after every major update, the whole group is informed via WhatsApp group. Furthermore, we decided on a color palette (light mode colors) to use so that we don’t drift from the theme.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Working together gave a sense of how important it is for each member to have their opinion and suggestions taken into consideration since it could lead to great ideas that would benefit the overall project. In addition, it provides each member with exposure to different perspectives coming from other teammates in the group. Collaborating with others seemed very essential since the individual’s work is being reviewed by other members, and feedback is then given for further improvement.
                    <br>To sum up, exchanging skills and knowledge with each other  was a convenient and productive way to provide the best output and gain extra knowledge from other members of the group.
                    While working in the group, each member felt pressured and driven to do their best, which encouraged us to interact, self-manage, and decision-make. Moreover, to contribute to the team and individually fulfil our work to its maximum potential to achieve the criteria of the project and to target the highest mark possible.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During the process of the project, some technical objectives were acquired. First, the use of iframe tag in HTML to add an embedded Google Map of the coffee shop location. Second, round the edges of the buttons used using the CSS property (border-radius). Furthermore, how to apply an import to an external font family style using (@import url) in CSS.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, when self-reflecting, the group would need to work on their time management to avoid any unnecessary stress, rush of assigned work, and delay of project completion. Also, the group communication principle could be enhanced by focusing on giving direct feedback on updated work.</p>
